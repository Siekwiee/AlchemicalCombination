# Alchemical Combinations

An enchanting idle game where you discover the secrets of alchemy by combining elements to create powerful new substances, unlock recipes, and build your alchemical empire.

## What is an Idle Game?

Idle games (also known as incremental games) are games where progress continues even when you're not actively playing. In Alchemical Combinations:

- Automated processes work for you while you're away
- Strategic decisions multiply your productivity
- Discover new combinations and unlock content as you progress
- Balance active gameplay with idle mechanics for optimal advancement

## Core Concept: Alchemical Combinations

At the heart of the game is the alchemical grid system where:

- Combine basic elements to discover new compounds
- Place elements on a grid and watch them interact
- Discover hidden recipes through experimentation
- Unlock rare and legendary combinations with special properties
- Experience visual effects that bring your discoveries to life

## Key Features

- **Elemental Discovery**: Start with basic elements (earth, fire, water, air) and discover hundreds of combinations
- **Production Automation**: Build and upgrade automated production lines
- **Progression System**: Unlock new laboratories, equipment, and research capabilities
- **Lucky Combinations**: Chance-based system for rare discoveries
- **Visual Feedback**: Beautiful particle effects showcase your successful combinations
- **Modular Grid System**: Expand your laboratory as you progress

## Quick Start Guide

1. Begin with basic elements available in your starter laboratory
2. Drag elements onto the combination grid
3. Discover new compounds by combining elements
4. Use compounds to unlock equipment upgrades
5. Set up automated production chains
6. Expand your grid to create more complex combinations

## Advanced Mechanics

### Element Properties

Elements have unique properties that affect combinations:

- **Potency**: Determines the strength of reactions
- **Stability**: Affects the success rate of combinations
- **Rarity**: Determines the value of resulting compounds

### Prestige System

Once you've mastered the basics:

- Reset your progress for powerful multipliers
- Unlock new alchemical schools with unique mechanics
- Preserve key discoveries through resets
