Now you will have to answer my question exact, correct and consice please. Also accept for if i tell you so i dont want you a fat output of code from you. If i explain something or show you my code that is for context i want to understand and make the architecture myself. i want to feel it. i will ask Qeustions and then want you to explain the concept behind that. because of the fact that often times those things are abstract or just complex or both please explain in a way it is very understandable you may be talking to a not too experienced person. you ready to basically teach?? i hope so!
